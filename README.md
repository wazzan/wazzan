###### 🕵️‍♂️ who am i? 

nobody. maybe someone. definitely not an AI.  

###### 👾 what i do?  

- i try to write code. it never works.  
- i try other peoples code, and then it breaks.
- i commit, then instantly regret.

###### 🎲 random facts  

- tabs > spaces (fight me).  
- i once fixed a bug by deleting the whole project.

###### 🎞 fractured lines

***keys clatter in the fog. what builds here dissolves at dusk***

- 42 steps to nowhere.
- the cursor blinks, but never tells.
- beneath the commits, something stirs.

###### 🧑‍💻 to the ***real*** coders

to the ones who build, break, and fix.
who turn logic into magic and chaos into code.
your work powers the world, often unseen, but never unappreciated.

thank you for every line, every fix, and every late night.
the digital age exists because of you.
